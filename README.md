## Forking this repo

While I believe in the value of open-source projects, it's disheartening to discover that someone has copied my site without giving credit. I've dedicated a significant amount of time and effort into building and designing this iteration of my portfolio website, and I take pride in it. Therefore, I kindly request that you refrain from claiming this work as your own
